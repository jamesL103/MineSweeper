# Minesweeper
Small personal project that is a clone of minesweeper.
Very scuffed and limited in enjoyability but it is functional.

## Feature Notes
- Singleplayer, with a basic GUI to generate games.
- Game can be customized to different sizes and mine amounts.
- Can be built and deployed from the Gradle Wrapper into a .JAR executable.
